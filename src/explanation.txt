////  Difference between extends and implements
In JavaScript, extends and implements are used in the context of object-oriented programming (OOP), especially with classes. They help define how classes and objects are structured and interact. Let's break down each one:

extends:

The extends keyword is used in class inheritance. It allows one class to inherit properties and methods from another class.

When a class extends another class, it means the subclass will have access to the properties and methods of the superclass (parent class).

This is how you create a child class that inherits behavior from a parent class.

Example of extends:
class Animal {
  makeSound() {
    console.log("Some generic animal sound");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  makeSound() {
    console.log("Bark");
  }
}

const dog = new Dog();
dog.makeSound(); // Output: "Bark"


In this example:

Dog extends Animal, so Dog inherits the makeSound method from Animal.

The Dog class can also override the inherited method, like in this case where it changes the makeSound to "Bark".

implements:

The implements keyword is not a part of JavaScript. It is used in TypeScript (a superset of JavaScript).

In TypeScript, implements is used to ensure that a class follows a certain structure defined by an interface.

An interface is like a blueprint that defines a set of methods (and sometimes properties) that a class must implement.

The class that implements the interface is required to define all methods and properties declared in the interface.

Example of implements in TypeScript:
interface Animal {
  makeSound(): void;
}

class Dog implements Animal {
  makeSound() {
    console.log("Bark");
  }
}

const dog = new Dog();
dog.makeSound(); // Output: "Bark"


In this TypeScript example:

Animal is an interface, which specifies that any class that implements it must have a makeSound method.

Dog implements the Animal interface, so it must provide its own version of the makeSound method.

Summary:

extends (JavaScript): Used for class inheritance. A class can extend another class, inheriting its properties and methods.

implements (TypeScript, not JavaScript): Used to ensure that a class follows a structure defined by an interface. A class that implements an interface must define all the methods and properties that the interface declares.
